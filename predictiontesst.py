#This code assumes that you have already trained and saved a classification model named my_model.h5, 
# and that you have a test set of data loaded into the variable X_test. The predict_proba() method will return an array of probability values, 
# one for each class, for each sample in the test set. In this example, the probabilities are printed for each sample.
